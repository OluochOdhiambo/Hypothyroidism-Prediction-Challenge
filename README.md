#### By **{OluochOdhiambo}**
## Task Description
i. Provide insight on the data set through exploratory data analysis.

ii. Create a multiple classification models to predict an individual's hypothyroid status based on the available information. The models include: 
Decision Trees

* Random Forest Classification Model
* Ada Boosted Classification Model 
* Gradient Boosted Classification Model

Support Vector Machine
* Support Classification Model(Linear kernel)
* Support Classification Model(Polynomial kernel)
* Support Classification Model(Sigmoid kernel)
* Support Classification Model(RBF kernel)

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Github
* Jupyter Notebook
